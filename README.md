# Simple-NFA-to-DFA-Converter
A simple NFA to DFA converter where we have assumed there will be only two "Input". There is no limit to how many "States there can be. The input NFA and the output DFA are both stored in separate .txt files. While editing the the "NFA_input.txt" file, make sure to follow the convention followed to create the NFA table.
